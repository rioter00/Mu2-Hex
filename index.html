		<div>Hex is our offense.
It’s different than other offensive sets (like Horizontal stack and Vertical stack). But understanding Hex will help you also understand other offensive sets. Consider this a guide to help you understand µ2’s Hex offense. It’s totally okay if you’ve run Hex before or are familiar with other versions. If you are new to Hex or have some experience you should find this useful for running µ2’s Hex.
</div>
		<div>Hex</div>
		<div>hext ></div>
		<div>Backs</div>
		<div>It starts with a shape. One of the defining aspects of Hex is the formation.We will 99% of the time will run a flat Hex shape. As opposed to a pointed Hex shape. The positions we use are backs (2), hub (1), wings (2), and deeps (2).These positions stay in relative position to the shape as the disc advances up the field. If you start out at a certain position, your identity and expected movement pattern do not stay with you as you move away from your ‘original’ position. 
As this is a starting point, there will be times when the shape deforms as cutters leave positions and the disc moves. At any given time, these position should be filled, cut into, or cut out of BUT never should there be two/more offensive players occupying the same position/field space.

		<div>Basic movement pattern #From the Disc’s Perspective. The disc wants to move to the next most easy spot, even if going backwards or sideways. #Take the easy optionThe disc wants to continue in the same direction, as long as it’s an easy option. #Keep pushingIf motion stalls or there aren’t easy options, then swing, dump, or break. Dumps and swings should be easy in a Hex offense. #Look to the Center


</div>
		<div>Offense</div>
		<div>Hex’s Basic Shape: Triangle
Hexagon is built out of triangles, and this can help usorient our ‘looks’ on offense.
At any time, when facing the center of the shape, there should be two triangles that the disc/thrower is a part of.
Between those two triangles, an easy option should exist.
'Looking at the center’ is a guiding principle of Hex flow, as it provides the most options at any given time.</div>
		<div>"Dribbling" #From the Thrower’s Perspective. As someone who has just thrown the disc, you are in a very powerful position (because of the basic spacing the Hex provides) to throw and go / give-go / ‘dribble’.If you are the receiver of a throw from a dribbler, you can facilitate the movement by ‘dishing’ back to the dribbler. These dishes are often 1) straight back towards dribbler, so they can run at you or 2) a side dish (back toward the center of the field).

		<div>Hex - µ2 Offense - Menu</div>
		<div>Mu’s Movement Patterns:Typically starts from a dead disc, bricked pulled, off a pull.
With the disc at one of the two backs…Looking downfield…Going Left to Right (always)…We can think of the downfield cutters forming three triangles.And we can address the cutters by their triangles.

</div>
		<div>1</div>
		<div>2</div>
		<div>Movement Pattern - 1
</div>
		<div>3</div>
		<div>Typically a call will be made to initiate movement.This call includes 1) WHO is involved and 2) WHAT DIRECTION the movement is.1. WHO is the triangle number: “1", “2", “3"2. WHAT DIRECTION: a. default is CLOCKWISE (do not say ‘clockwise’, just the triangle number)b. ANTI/COUNTERCLOCKWISE, you say “A”Example:“2” - Triangle 2 Clockwise motion
"3 A” - triangle 3 Anti-Clockwise motion

</div>
		<div>Movement Pattern - 2
</div>
		<div>“2” - Triangle 2 Clockwise motion

The point of this is to initiate movement.
Secondarily, we are hoping to move the defense, so an easy look/throw emerges. 
#CreateOptionsWithMotion
If a good look emerges, we can take that throw. You don’t have to throw if it’s a not a good option.
 
For the sake of our offense, we’ll call a ‘rotation’ “moving from one triangle node to another”.
 
If there is no throw on the first ‘rotation’, we want to cutters to move through their second ‘rotation’.Why? 1. We might not have shaken our defender.
 2. We need to motion to get another look.
We’ll likely look for a swing if something doesn’t emerge —
 thrower will address the other back or wing.</div>
		<div>Movement Pattern - 3
</div>
		<div>1 A</div>
		<div>Calls should be made understanding matchups, field conditions, thrower’s comfort on breakthrows.
 
The position of the Disc, which triangle, and the direction called have impactful differences.
 
With the disc on "Back Left”,
 
"1” gives you two “close” options and one medium option.
 
“2” mainly gives you one “close” option and two medium options.
 
“3” mainly gives you the “close” center option.
 



</div>
		<div>Movement Pattern - 4
</div>
		<div>D1 starts with the disc with a back. As the play starts, wings shift back to give the hub a lot of space in the middle of field. The original D1 triangle advances the disc as much as possible.
If downfield defenders peel off to poach, then that non-D1 offender can be involved with punishing the poach.</div>
		<div>D1</div>
		<div>D1 - top four stay out of the way</div>
		<div>Dominator One
</div>
		<div>D2</div>
		<div>D2 - bottom four stay out of the way</div>
		<div>Dominator Two
</div>
		<div>D2 starts with the disc with a back. As the play starts, wings shift to the side to give the hub a lot of space in the middle of field. The hub gets the disc, the D2 triangle is left to dominate the rest of the field.
They could have the possibility for a long throw, but with so much field, 3 v 3 should be easy without long throws.The “non-D2” teammates trail far enough back so their defenders do not peel to help defend. When executed smoothly, the other defenders will not know what is happening until it’s too late to help.</div>
		<div>Dominators
</div>
		<div>µ2 has two dominator plays.
“D1”- Dominator One“D2”- Dominator TwoThe dominator triangle advances the disc while the other four stay out of the way, keeping defenders occupied.The two dominators play slightly differently as D2 has more downfield space.</div>
		<div>The shape will deform while in flow AND we have to really try to keep relational distances from each other and avoid clumping. Hex loses all its magical power if we clump.

Saying it again, differently: 



Even though the shape deforms, we must not double occupy the same space. 
</div>
		<div>“Sideline” on Home side
</div>
		<div>Sideline
</div>
		<div>"Home"
</div>
		<div>µ2 has one main sideline ‘play’.‘Sideline’ is typically called off a dead disc or stoppage of play.Unlike our motion patterns, ‘Sideline’ is mirrored vertically. For the sake of this demonstration, the “Home” and “Away” side were arbitrarily chosen.Goals:Initate motionGet the disc off the side line
</div>
		<div>“Away” Sideline
</div>
		<div>D2
</div>
		<div>B1
</div>
		<div>Sideline - Reads and motion
</div>
		<div>W2
</div>
		<div>As sideline is called, the thrower and hub are ‘reading’ Hub and Hub’s defender. 

1. The connection between the Hub and thrower are really important.

2. Hub can decide to do one of two things:
A. Drive up-line towards D1 starting position
B. Fake up-line and get the disc mid field.The next two pages will demo the two variations.
3. In both variations, D1 cuts deep, opening space up-line for Hub.

		<div>Open space</div>
		<div>D1
</div>
		<div>Sideline, where Hub goes upline
</div>
		<div>Sideline - Upline
</div>
		<div>As the initial part of this play (regardless of variation) is a read-n-react between the thrower and hub, the thrower is staying oriented with the Hub until they either continue up-line or back to the center.
The thrower can take options of Hub or D1. 
D2 moves toward the center position. 

After 3-4 counts, B1, B2, W2 should activate.
W2 Could fill the center position,B1 should look for a dump-swing or attach upline if open. B2 should fill or look to followup off B1/W2.

		<div>Sideline - Center
</div>
		<div>As the initial part of this play (regardless of variation) is a read-n-react between the thrower and hub, the thrower is staying oriented with the Hub until they either continue up-line or back to the center.
If the Hub doubles back to the center, there are throwing options for Hub in the center, D2 cutting “in”, and W2

This is a great pattern to move the disc to the opposite sideline.
After 3-4 counts (if Hub/D1/D2 doesn’t get the disc), B1, B2, W2 should activate.
W2 Could fill the center position,
B1 should look for a dump-swing or attach upline if open. 
B2 should fill or look to followup off B1/W2.

		<div>“High Side” vs “Low Side”These two terms are used in relation to the field with moderate to high wind conditions, especially in cross winds.Imagine: because the wind is blowing in a certain direction, the disc wants to float toward the "low side" of the field. 
This gives us insight 1) on how to anticipate sailing/floating discs, 2) whether or not we want to force or play to the side. 
Some conventions: 
On Offense, we’d want to keep the disc on the high side. On Defense, we want to force toward the low side. </div>
		<div>Wind Direction</div>
		<div>Low Side</div>
		<div>High Side</div>
		<div>"Red Light" vs "Green Light”This an offensive terminology for “looks” and throws.
"Red Light” = 95%+ chance throws only. “Risky”, “Chancy”, throws all off the table.We almost wants want to thinking about beating teams “with our legs” / through motion.“Green Light” = with field conditions in our favor, matchups in our favor. 80% on the long throws. Medium range and short throws should stay ~90%.Different lines might receive different calls based on field conditions, personnel, matchups, etc.</div>
